# VAE Implementation

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Implementation on the 102 Category Flowers Dataset ðŸŒ¸
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for image generation and reconstruction, using the 102 Category Flowers Dataset from the Visual Geometry Group (VGG), University of Oxford ([dataset link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/)).

The VAE model is trained to encode flower images into a latent space and generate realistic flower images by sampling from this learned distribution. This project serves as an example of unsupervised learning using deep generative models.

Results can be viewed in VAE_implementation.pdf file.
